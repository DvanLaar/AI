a At first I programmed a largest distance heuristic, this already resulted in less then about 9500 nodes explored
which of course made me think is there an easy way to score some less nodes, quickly I realised I could also
inflate the heuristic by calculating the distance between the node furthest away and the one furthest away
on the other side of pacman, taking the shortest distance twice(which should really be the second one). This
resulted in less then 9000 nodes which we found satisfactory.
B we simply calculate the manhatten distance, with a bit of a complication to be able to distinguis between
having to go back and forth and simply the furthest point but anytime you take a step the heuristic will not 
decrease more then the cost of the step.
