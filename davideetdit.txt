the consistency of the two point method is easy to see, anytime a step is taken, there are two options, 
the furthest node doesn't change, in which case you get a maximum of the cost of the step closer to the second node,
and the furthest node from the furthest node doens't change either so the maximal reduction in cost is exactly the cost of one step.

the second option is that the furthest node does change, in which case all the distances change but they never get smaller then
the cost of the step taken. If a new node becomes the furthest away node it wil be equally far, or one further, away from the last
furthest away node. The node furthest away from this node can never be more then 1 cost less away then it was from the last node.
Because every node has a predefined value for the node furthest away, if a node is not in the boundry of the nodegroup it can't
be the node furthest away from the player, because there is always one futher away, if it is, it has nodes that are equally far
away from it as from the other furthest nodes, otherwise it wouldn't be a candidate for the furtherst node to begin with.
